print("Most of the world is still reliant on fossil fuels like gas, coal, and oil. Since the 70’s, our greenhouse gas emissions have increased by around 90%! \nFossil fuels and industrial production reliant on fossil fuels are estimated to account for 78% of our total greenhouse gas emission increase from 1970 to 2011. \nBecause fossil fuels are responsible for such a big part of our greenhouse gas emissions, it is important to start switching to more renewable and green energy sources for our daily needs. \nHere are some ways to do this!")

There is a reason for this. It has to do with dishwashers, dryers, washers, air conditioners, trains, cars and factories. Most of earth's energy is still reliant on fossil fuels with realse greenhouse gasses. Saving your energy can lessen these emmisions!")
